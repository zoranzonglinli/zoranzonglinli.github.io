Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am a Lecturer in the [School of Computing at Harbin Institute of Technology](https://computing.hit.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Shengping Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangshengping). I received my Ph.D. from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Shengping Zhang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhangshengping), and my M.S. from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Zhihong Mao](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/zhi-hong-mao/). My research focuses on ***Multi-modal Learning***, ***Digital Humans***, ***Motion Synthesis and Video Generation***, aiming to advance AI techniques for cross-modal perception, realistic virtual human generation, and immersive content creation.
